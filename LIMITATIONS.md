# Known limitations

This is the list of known ~issues~ limitations.

## File sharing

* Maximal level of nested directories in code/data folders is 50;
* Ignores empty folders in code/data;
* When a file is shared and later renamed, DataExchange will still see it with the old name. Workaround: unshare/share again.
