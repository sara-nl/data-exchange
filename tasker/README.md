# DataExchange tasker ðŸŽ†

Tasker is a decoupled component, which executes long-running tasks and notifies about the results. It depends on [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), which implements [AMQP 0.9.1 protocol](https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/amqp-concepts.html). 

âš  AMQP is a programmable protocol, which gives application developers a lot of freedom, so it's a good idea to understand basic concepts of AMQP before changing this service.
